<p>As the <a target="_blank" href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> eco-system is still very immature it can sometimes be very frustrating to develop on this platform. Gradually more tools are being developed that make it much easier, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190812051419/https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/">Browser Solidity</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://makerdao.com/">Maker</a> have released a new tool called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NexusDevelopment/dapple">Dapple</a>. It's purpose is to provide a lot of scaffolding around dapp development. It comprises: package management, Solidity preprocessor (cog), Solidity testing, deployment and chain contexts.</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with its Solidity testing suite.</p>
<p>First of all you need to install Dapple.</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/NexusDevelopment/dapple.git
cd dapple
sudo python setup.py install
```

<p>The command `dapple` will now be available.</p>
<p>You now need to initialize your dapp as a dapple project:</p>

```
dapple init
```

<p>Then edit `.dapple/dappfile` and populate the name and version fields.</p>
<p>Now add the `.dapple` dir to your Git repo:</p>

```
git add .dapple
git commit -m "Dapplize"
```

<p>You can now start writing tests for your Solidity code. The great thing about Dapple tests is that they are written in Solidity just like the code you are testing.</p>
<p>Contracts that are tests need to inherit from the Dapple Test contract. For example:</p>

```sol
import "core/test.sol";

contract MyContractTest is Test {
}
```

<p>You can put your test contract in a separate file. You will then need to import the contract you are testing:</p>

```sol
import "my_contract.sol";
```

<p>Every function in the test contract that starts with `test` will be executed in a fresh environment. The function `setUp` will be called before each test is invoked.</p>
<p>Typically you need to instantiate the contract that you are testing:

```sol
MyContract myContractInstance = new MyContract();
```
  
<p>You can then make calls into the contract and use Dapple's suite of assert functions to ensure that it is operating correctly.</p>
<p>I have created a pastebin contract called Etherbin and written Dapple tests for it: <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190812051419/https://github.com/bluedroplet/etherbin-api">https://github.com/bluedroplet/etherbin-api</a></p>
<p>The tests complete in just a couple of seconds. They are run entirely in the vm and the blockchain is not utilized at all.</p>
