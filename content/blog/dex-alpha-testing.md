<p>The Acuity DEX is approaching minimum viable product. To begin with it will have a simple pair ACU / ETH. It will be possible to trade ETH stored in <a target="_blank" href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> for ACU stored in the <a target="_blank" href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/">Polkadot browser extension</a>. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-solidity">Solidity smart contracts</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-pallet">Substrate pallet</a> are both mature. Development of a Rust-based <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-off-chain">off-chain worker</a> to index the order book continues. Basic UI is coming together.</p>
<p>We will be adding many more pairs in future, including all ERC20 tokens, Avalanche, and Substrate chains that have enabled a supported pallet (Acuity, Contracts, or EVM).</p>
<p>Support for trading with Ethereum via new layer 2 technologies like <a target="_blank" href="https://optimism.io/">Optimism</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://arbitrum.io/">Abritrum</a> is a major priority to reduce transaction fees.</p>
