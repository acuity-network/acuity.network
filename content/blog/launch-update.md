<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-pallet">Acuity Atomic Swap Substrate pallet</a> has been updated to the final design of the DEX. This means that ACU (and any other <a target="_blank" href="https://substrate.io/">Substrate</a> chain that deploys the pallet) will be able to be traded on Acuity DEX.</p>


## ERC20 Token Support

<p>Trading the base coin of EVM blockchains is handled by the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-solidity/blob/main/src/AcuityAtomicSwap.sol">AcuityAtomicSwap</a> smart contract. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-solidity/blob/main/src/AcuityAtomicSwapERC20.sol">AcuityAtomicSwapERC20</a> and unit tests have now been written to handle trading of ERC20 tokens. Traders will be able to swap any ERC20 token between any supported EVM blockchains. Well-known tokens are hardcoded in the DEX app for ease of use and to prevent scams.</p>

## Ethereum PoS Merge

<p>After the successful GÃ¶rli testnet merge with its PoS beacon chain, the Ethereum mainet is <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/12/finalized-no-36/">scheduled</a> to follow around 15th September. There are at least two projects intending to continue the original PoW chain: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/EthereumPoW">EthereumPoW</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/EthereumFair">Ethereum Fair</a>. This is essentially a massive airdrop to anyone who holds ETH or Ethereum tokens.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that there will be considerable demand for trade between the new PoS Ethereum and the PoW forks. Acuity DEX will support permissionless peer-to-peer trading of base coins and ERC20 tokens between these chains.</p>

## Road To Launch

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Update front-end to support latest features</li>
    <li>Review all code for robustness and write more tests</li>
    <li>Update Acuity blockchain to latest runtime</li>
    <li>Deploy Acuity smart contracts to EVM chains</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>It is anticipated to have the DEX live before the Ethereum PoS Merge.</p>
