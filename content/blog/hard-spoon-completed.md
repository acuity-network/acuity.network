<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/glossary#hard-spoon">hard spoon</a> announced in the previous blog post has now occurred. At block #3276706 a snapshot was recorded of all ACU balances and unclaimed MIX => ACU.</p>
<p>A new genesis block was created and the new blockchain started to facilitate the upcoming launch of the <router-link to="/atomic-swap">Acuity DEX</router-link>. This was the third (and hopefully final) hard spoon that has been performed on the Acuity blockchain.</p>
<p>If you are running a full node, you will need to update to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-substrate/releases">latest release</a> of the Acuity software and sync from scratch.</p>
<p>The Polkadot <a target="_blank" href="https://polkadot.acuity.social/">web interface</a> for Acuity has been updated to the latest version and is now connected to the new blockchain. You might need to give it a hard refresh.</p>
<p>All balances have been brought over to the new blockchain. Our exchange partner <a target="_blank" href="https://app.stex.com/en/trading/pair/ETH/ACU/1D">STEX</a> has already updated their platform.</p>
<p>If you were staking, either as a nominator or a validator, you will need to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Cju6M06MQ">set this up</a> again.</p>
<p>We can now move forward with launching the Acuity Atomic Swap Exchange that will enable fully decentralized trade between many different blockchains.</p>
