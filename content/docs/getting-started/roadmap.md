## Acuity Index

Currently [Acuity Index](https://index.acuity.network/) can index Polkadot, Kusama, Westend and Paseo. A release needs to be made so that the Acuity blockchain can be indexed.

## Forum

Until the Acuity Dapp is mature enough to use as a discussion platform, an instance of [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) will be the official place to discuss Acuity.

## Acuity Dapp

The official Acuity Dapp will be written in [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) for browser, desktop and mobile, using Acuity Index as a backend.

Features:
* ACU wallet
* Image publishing
* Profile publishing
* Feed publishing / subscribing
* Forums
* Video transcoding
* Wikis

## Trading

List ACU on [Hydration](https://hydration.net/) so it can be traded on the free market.

## Content Moderation Court

When moderating an online community it is essential that rules are enforced consistently. Having an elected moderation court will be critical to ensure moderators do not abuse their power.

## Content Coins

Every content creator having a coin to monetize their brand has been a key concept in Acuity since the [beginning](/blog/blockchain-crowdfunding/).

## AI Content Classification

Index operators will be able to use AI to classify and not index illegal / immoral content on their service.
