### Switch from log storage to IPFS

3rd June 2017

Here is the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acuity-social/mix-item-store/commit/cf818ec28a236e6f1966a22f0dcd45eef267f6f2">commit</a>.

### MIX Acuity Browser released

It also has in-app mining.

### MIX Acuity web app

November 2019

The MIX Acuity browser was very powerful, but it had a problem - installing it was a huge barrier to entry. Having it available as a web app meant content could be linked to directly from other web sites. Because the desktop app had been built with Electron and web technologies, creating a web app build was fairly easy.

### Video publishing functionality

20th January 2020

The desktop app could transcoded the video to multiple resolutions and video could be streamed from IPFS in both the web app and the desktop app. Additionally a command line utility could synchronize video from YouTube to Acuity.

Additionally the MIX name is being droped entirely in favour of ACUITY. Here\'s the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqgqCEQW9o">video announcement</a>.
